Hello, on my project, I faced a lot of challenges that made me better at website designing. I had to look online for everything and learned from YouTube, including ChatGPT.

It seems that I need to work more cleanly and organized while using HTML & CSS because you can get lost very quickly, and that made me work twice the time. I have learned to write scripts that will change elements difficulty (navbar), learned to hide things that are not relevant, and to adjust my website for mobile. I also learned that there is so much in this world, and I don't know even a bit about it.

It was really satisfying to work on the website and to become more familiar with the tools. The website structure includes the Home page, About Myself, Skills, Projects (with this website being the first) and Contact. I got that idea from another website that I saw online.
